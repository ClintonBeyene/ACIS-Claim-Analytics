    "#### Risk Differences Between Extended Titles:\n",
    "- **ANOVA**: ( f_stat = 1.169 ), ( p_value = 0.322 )\n",
    "  - **Conclusion**: Fail to reject the null hypothesis. This suggests no significant difference in risk (TotalClaims) among the extended titles based on ANOVA.\n",

    "  - **Conclusion**: Reject the null hypothesis. This suggests a significant difference in risk (TotalClaims) among the extended titles based on the Kruskal-Wallis test.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "- **ANOVA vs. Kruskal-Wallis**: The discrepancy between the ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis results could be due to the assumptions each test makes. ANOVA assumes normally distributed data and equal variances, while Kruskal-Wallis is a non-parametric test that does not make these assumptions. The significant results from the Kruskal-Wallis test suggest that there might be differences in the distributions of TotalClaims across titles that ANOVA did not detect due to its assumptions.\n",
    "- **Imbalance in Data**: The large number of “Mr” entries compared to other titles might influence the results. The Kruskal-Wallis test is more robust to such imbalances, which might explain why it detected significant differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Further Analysis**: Consider visualizing the data distributions (e.g., box plots) to better understand the differences in TotalClaims across titles.\n",
    "- **Data Balancing**: If feasible, balance the data (e.g., through resampling) to see if the results hold.\n",
    "- **Additional Tests**: Explore other non-parametric tests or regression models to further validate the findings.\n"

    "\n",
    "- **Non-normality**: The dataset contains categorical variables and count data, which are unlikely to be normally distributed. Kruskal-Wallis is a non-parametric test that doesn't assume normality.\n",
    "- **Unequal variances**: The dataset has a large number of observations, and it's likely that the variances of the groups are not equal. Kruskal-Wallis doesn't assume equal variances.\n",
    "- **Comparing medians**: Since the dataset contains count data and categorical variables, comparing medians might be more meaningful than comparing means. Kruskal-Wallis compares medians.\n",
    "- **Robustness**: Kruskal-Wallis is a robust test that can handle outliers and non-normal data, which is common in real-world datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some potential research questions that I could explore using the Kruskal-Wallis test include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is there a significant difference in the distribution of vehicle types (e.g., passenger vehicle, medium commercial, heavy commercial) across different regions (e.g., Transvaal South East, Natal 1, East London)?\n",
    "- Is there a significant difference in the distribution of cover types (e.g., own damage, passenger liability, windscreen) across different vehicle makes (e.g., Toyota, Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen)?\n",
    "- Is there a significant difference in the distribution of policy values (e.g., total premium, total claims) across different cover groups (e.g., comprehensive, third party, fire and theft)?\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the Kruskal-Wallis test, I can determine if there are significant differences in the medians of these variables across different groups, without assuming normality or equal variances.\n",
